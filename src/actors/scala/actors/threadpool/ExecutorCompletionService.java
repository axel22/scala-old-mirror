/**
 * A {@link CompletionService} that uses a supplied {@link Executor}
 * to execute tasks.  This class arranges that submitted tasks are,
 * upon completion, placed on a queue accessible using <tt>take</tt>.
 * The class is lightweight enough to be suitable for transient use
 * when processing groups of tasks.
 *
 * <p>
 *
 * <b>Usage Examples.</b>
 *
 * Suppose you have a set of solvers for a certain problem, each
 * returning a value of some type <tt>Result</tt>, and would like to
 * run them concurrently, processing the results of each of them that
 * return a non-null value, in some method <tt>use(Result r)</tt>. You
 * could write this as:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   void solve(Executor e,
 *              Collection&lt;Callable&lt;Result&gt;&gt; solvers)
 *     throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
 *       CompletionService&lt;Result&gt; ecs
 *           = new ExecutorCompletionService&lt;Result&gt;(e);
 *       for (Callable&lt;Result&gt; s : solvers)
 *           ecs.submit(s);
 *       int n = solvers.size();
 *       for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
 *           Result r = ecs.take().get();
 *           if (r != null)
 *               use(r);
 *       }
 *   }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Suppose instead that you would like to use the first non-null result
 * of the set of tasks, ignoring any that encounter exceptions,
 * and cancelling all other tasks when the first one is ready:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   void solve(Executor e,
 *              Collection&lt;Callable&lt;Result&gt;&gt; solvers)
 *     throws InterruptedException {
 *       CompletionService&lt;Result&gt; ecs
 *           = new ExecutorCompletionService&lt;Result&gt;(e);
 *       int n = solvers.size();
 *       List&lt;Future&lt;Result&gt;&gt; futures
 *           = new ArrayList&lt;Future&lt;Result&gt;&gt;(n);
 *       Result result = null;
 *       try {
 *           for (Callable&lt;Result&gt; s : solvers)
 *               futures.add(ecs.submit(s));
 *           for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i) {
 *               try {
 *                   Result r = ecs.take().get();
 *                   if (r != null) {
 *                       result = r;
 *                       break;
 *                   }
 *               } catch (ExecutionException ignore) {}
 *           }
 *       }
 *       finally {
 *           for (Future&lt;Result&gt; f : futures)
 *               f.cancel(true);
 *       }
 *
 *       if (result != null)
 *           use(result);
 *   }
 * </pre>
